## Background
Have you seen the Google Earth's new Timelapse feature?

[Click here to see Google Earth Timelapse Climate Change](https://www.ecowatch.com/google-earth-timelapse-climate-change-2652595487.html)

Inspired by the Timeplase features and the Earth Day celebration, our team wanted to develop a dashboard that showcases changes in CO2 emissions by country relative to population changes from 2006-2016. We also thought it would be a cool idea to see if there were popular trends in environment-related keywords searches during 2006-2016. 

## Objectives
1. Visualize how CO2 emission changes are related to population changes
2. Visualize environment-related Google search trends using Pytrends

## Tools and Libraries the Project Uses
1. Data Cleaning
  - Pandas
  - Python
2. Data Visualizations
  - Leaflet 
  - Radial Barchart 
  - D3.json 
    - Multiple Line Graphs
    - Mouseover
3. Data Rendering
  - Flask
  - SQL Lite
5. Front-end Development
  - HTML
  - CSS
6. Heroku


## Sources and Datasets 
[World Bank Population Totals] (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?view=chart)

[World Bank CO2 Emissions by Country] (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?view=chart)

[Pytrends Library] (https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/)

## Sneak Peak of our Visualization
### Emissions by Income Level

The average total C02 emmissions by income level from 2006-2016. 

### C02 Emissions as it Realtes to Total Population

Pytrend Keywords Search Volume from 2004 to 2016.

Keywords: Clean Energy, Sustainability, Environment, Climate Change

> "For D3 beginners, I suggest to play around with the test example given and then plug in your dataset to the d3 template. 
> Also check which version you are using - syntax change accordingly."
