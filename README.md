## Background
Our team aims to develop a dashboard that showcases changes in CO2 emissions by country relative to population changes from 2006-2016. 
We also will be analyzing how searches and trends on Google related to environmental changes and sustainable goods change as CO2 emissions and population change by regions.

## Objectives
1. Visualize how CO2 emission changes are related to population changes
2. Learn how Google search trends for sustainable goods change alongside these two factors

## Tools and Libraries the Project Uses
1. Data Pulling and Cleaning
  - Python
   - Pandas
2. Data Visualizations
  - Leaflet 
  - Radial Barchart 
  - D3.json 
3. Rendering
  - Flask
  - SQL Lite
5. Front-end Development
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Sources and Datasets 
[World Bank Population Totals] (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?view=chart)

[World Bank CO2 Emissions by Country] (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?view=chart)

> "For D3 beginners, I suggest to play around with the test example given and then plug in your dataset to the d3 template. 
> Also check which version you are using - syntax change accordingly."
