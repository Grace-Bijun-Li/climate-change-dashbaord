## Background
Our team aims to develop a dashboard that showcases changes in CO2 emissions by country relative to population changes from 2006-2016. 
We also will be analyzing how searches and trends on Google related to environmental changes and sustainable goods change as CO2 emissions and population change by regions.

## Objectives
1. Visualize how CO2 emission changes are related to population changes
2. Learn how Google search trends for sustainable goods change alongside these two factors

## Tools and Libraries the Project Uses
1. Data Pulling and Cleaning
  - Python
   - Pandas
2. Data Visualizations
  - Leaflet
  - D3
  - Radial Barchart 
3. Rendering
  - Flask
  - SQL Light
5. Front-end Development
  - HTML
  - CSS
