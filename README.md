## Background
Our team aims to develop a dashboard that showcases changes in CO2 emissions by country relative to population changes from 2006-2016. 
We also will be analyzing how searches and trends on Google related to environmental changes and sustainable goods change as CO2 emissions and population change by regions.
## Objectives
1. Visualize how CO2 emission changes are related to population changes
2. Learn how Google search trends for sustainable goods change alongside these two factors
